    <h1>Pineal Guardian Complaints: The Truth Behind the Supplement</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>You've probably come across <strong>Pineal Guardian</strong>‚Äîa supplement claiming to support spiritual clarity, third eye awakening, and cognitive enhancement. But before you hit the purchase button, you might be wondering: are there real <strong>Pineal Guardian complaints</strong> I should be concerned about?</p>

    <h2>What Is Pineal Guardian?</h2>
    <p>Pineal Guardian is a natural supplement designed to detoxify the pineal gland, also known as the ‚Äúthird eye.‚Äù It includes ingredients that claim to decalcify the pineal gland, improve intuition, enhance sleep quality, and restore mental clarity.</p>

    <p>Some of the key ingredients include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Iodine (for detoxification)</li>
      <li>Chlorella (a natural binder of heavy metals)</li>
      <li>Shilajit (known for brain-boosting effects)</li>
      <li>Fulvic acid, bentonite clay, and more</li>
    </ul>
